If you have a friend group, you can invite them all as editors, then duplicate the default sheet for each friend to compare prices!

## Editing the Script

1. Open `Tools` / `Script Editor`
2. Select `Run` / `Run Function` / `priceTest`
3. An in-window popup will ask you for permissions. Select `Review Permissions`
4. Another popup will ask which Google Account you want to link this script to. `Continue`.
5. A very menacing page will explain that this script isn't verified through Google. To continue, click the tiny text `Advanced` near the bottom, then click `Go to Stalks (unsafe)`
6. Finally, select `Allow`
